## The Geek Freaks Tuning Pack 4.1

This is a very early alpha in which the project is located. We are not responsible for any problems associated with the execution of our program.
So far, very few functions are implemented. This will change over the next few months.
This is a hobby project! Everything can cause mistakes and create problems! Use at your own risk!
Everything is based on PowerShell. The performance will improve even more.
Bugs, suggestions for improvement and Feeback will be read gladly. For this you can simply use the discord: https://discord.gg/qrXmqSq

### Changelog

[Changelog](https://github.com/MinersWin/TGF-Tuning-Pack-4.0/wiki/Changelog)

### Known bugs

There are only a few functions, but this will be fixed until December. At Christmas, the Tuning Pack will be released in full functionality.

There are parts of the program cut off or postponed, then I ask you to write me an email, including the OS version, PowerShell and .Net framework version and screen size and resolution.

### Support or Contact

You have problems with the tuning pack? [Discord](https://discord.gg/qrXmqSq) or write at TuningPack@MinersWin.de

### The old Tuning Pack 3.1

You can download the old tuning pack [here](https://thegeekfreaks.de/download/the-geek-freaks-tuning-pack-3-1/). The new builds mostly on the old, but includes some new features and finally a GUI. In order to avoid virus reproaches or the like, the entire project is published on GitHub and development is traceable right from the start. Tuning Pack 4.0 is mostly developed by [MinersWin](https://www.youtube.com/minerswin).
